                I am a computer science student and frontend developer with experience building web applications using ReactJS and other JavaScript technologies. I have a passion for coding and building software solutions. In my free time, I like to write blog posts to share my knowledge with the community and document my learning journey.
                <br/><br/>
                My goal with this blog is to write about web development, JavaScript, ReactJS, and other topics that I am exploring. I hope these posts provide value to other developers and students. I am continuously learning and improving my craft, so my posts represent my current knowledge - but I have much more to learn. Feel free to provide feedback or start a discussion on any of my posts.
                <br/><br/>
                When I'm not coding or writing blog posts, you can find me reading about new technologies, spending time with friends and family, or staying active by going on hikes. I believe maintaining a work-life balance is important for sustained creativity and productivity.
